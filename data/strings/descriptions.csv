fs_terran_verylightbeam,WEAPON,"Used on the Fenris cruiser, the much-maligned lighter cousin of the Forge Eagle tactical beam is limited by the power grid of the ship that mounts it. Incapable of prolonged individual bursts, it relies on its relatively short recharge time to compensate for its low damage output. The Forge Dove is an unhappy compromise, arguably inferior to the fusion mortar system it is mounted alongside.",Assault,,
fs_terran_lightbeam,WEAPON,"The lightest tactical beam in the Terran arsenal, the Subach-Innes Cruiser Engagement System was built small and accurate, but at the cost of rate of fire. Its capacitors' long rise time, coupled with plasma core flow issues, hobble it with a 45-second charge cycle. Its compact mountings allow multiple beams to be fitted even on cruisers.",Assault,,
fs_terran_mediumbeam,WEAPON,"The RNI Tactical Beam System, codenamed 'Forge Eagle', is a mid-range tactical plasma beam with an efficiency-boosting twist. It uses a sweeping magnetic bottle to guide a relativistic plasma stream through contained arcs. Although it offers limited hull penetration, it is capable of firing even without accurate targeting solutions. Current GTVA combat doctrine calls for these weapons to be used to disarm or disable enemy vessels quickly. Forge Eagles are used as the main weapons of the flexible Deimos corvette and as a battery weapon on larger warships.",Assault,,
fs_terran_heavybeam,WEAPON,"The Subach-Innes Warship Engagement System, codenamed 'Crypt Hammer', was the primary GTVA destroyer beam during the Second Shivan Incursion. Reliable, accurate, easy to maintain, and highly robust, the Crypt Hammer remains a favorite of Terran warship crews. It provides the main tactical power of Orion and Hecate combatants. It has one of the lowest failure rates of any GTVA weapons system, but it produces copious heat and its mountings are bulky.",Assault,,
fs_vasudan_lightbeam,WEAPON,"Mekhu Enterprises and the Akheton Corporation collaborated to design Vasudan beam systems, making grim but effective use of hours of scans gathered while the Lucifer bombarded Vasuda Prime. The 121b Beam System are used as a supplementary weapon on Vasudan destroyers, where it has earned high praise - it outperforms even Shivan beam weapons.",Assault,,
fs_vasudan_mediumbeam,WEAPON,"Mekhu Enterprises science teams focused on maximizing beam effect rather than power, using an arcing magnetic bottle to cut a path across the target. Due to Vasudan expertise in power grid design, the 183 outperforms its Terran equivalent by a small margin.",Assault,,
fs_vasudan_heavybeam,WEAPON,"The Mekhu/Akheton 255a destroyer-mounted heavy beam uses a coaxial sensor suite to analyze debris spall from the target and uses that data to fine-tune beam radius and velocity for maximum effect. This striking piece of technology, later implemented in next-generation beam weapons, was developed by the Akheton Corporation based on systems used in the SDG. Sophisticated but power-hungry, the 255a outperforms its Terran equivalent by a small margin.",Assault,,
fs_shivan_beam,WEAPON,"Alliance beam cannons were reverse-engineered from scans of the Lucifer. Shivan beam weapons systems continue to outperform them, offering comparable or superior firepower with reduced power drain and heat output. This beam cannon is a cruiser-grade weapons system used for direct-fire engagement of hostile targets. It is a serious but not overwhelming threat to Allied warships. Pilots who see a charging beam should break to avoid its path.",Assault,,
fs_shivan_heavybeam,WEAPON,"The hellishly powerful Shivan destroyer-grade beam system annihilates layers of collapsed molybdenum armor with contemptuous ease. Firing a jet of tightly contained plasma at relativistic velocities, this beam system overmatches any warship in the GTVA arsenal. The heavy beam cannon is integral to Shivan shock-jump tactics, and provides a near-insurmountable advantage in line engagements. It is capable of near-continuous fire, and yet, frighteningly, its power requirements are so low that it can be mounted on modified cruisers.",Assault,,
,,,,,
fs_terran_aaabeam,WEAPON,"A light beam cannon with a fast-rise capacitor system, SPAR optical targeting, and an 1800-meter magnetic bottle, the Phalanx Point Defense Beam System can rapidly and accurately engage incoming fighters and warheads with quick pulses. In warship engagements, it can be fired as a direct beam to supplement main batteries. This weapons system is critical to warship close defense doctrine.",Anti-Fighter,,
fs_shivan_aaabeam,WEAPON,The Shivan anti-fighter weapons system is capable of near-continuous fire at slightly reduced energy levels compared to its GTVA equivalent.,Anti-Fighter,,
,,,,,
fs_pulsecannon,WEAPON,"Bessimer-Kohn has manufactured countless 'Houndtooth' plasma pulse weapons. Classified as a Light Tactical Engagement System, the Houndtooth is used as a point defense gun and light attack option on Terran warships. It is compact, power efficient, and has excellent thermal characteristics, freeing up energy for subspace drive recharge and other vital functions.",Close Support,,
fs_heavypulsecannon,WEAPON,"The Bessimer-Kohn 'Djinn' heavy plasma pulse weapon offers enhanced range and damage at the cost of ROF and projectile speed. Considered long obsolete, the 'Djinn' remains in service only due to its low heat output and cost.",Close Support,,
fs_pulsecannon2,WEAPON,"Based off a standard Terran pulse cannon, the re-engineered Mekhu-Akheton version boasts a slightly faster fire rate, at the expense of raw damage.",Close Support,,
fs_heavypulsecannon2,WEAPON,"Based off a standard Terran heavy pulse cannon, the re-engineered Mekhu-Akheton version boasts a slightly faster fire rate, at the expense of raw damage.",Close Support,,
fs_shivan_turretlaser,WEAPON,"The Shivans' primary turret weapons system outperforms its Terran counterpart, the Houndtooth, in most respects. Shivan warships deploy this weapons system against incoming bombs, as a deterrent to fighters, and against hostile warships.",Close Support,,
fs_shivan_heavyturretlaser,WEAPON,"Firing excited plasma drawn directly from onboard reactors and barely confined by a projected magnetic bottle, this massive turret weapon is a serious threat to unshielded targets. Loose bolt cohesion, and the slow travel speed necessitated by the turret's magnetic manipulation, lessen its effectiveness against well-shielded or agile targets.",Close Support,,
,,,,,
fs_flak,WEAPON,"The flak gun is a post-Great War innovation and a key element of warship close defense doctrine. Firing caseless, smart-fused, electrically ignited explosive shells at barely subnuclear yields, the flak gun damages targets by fragmentation and blast. Modern flak guns can sustain area suppression barrages for minutes at a time before their ammunition is depleted. Although heat-efficient, flak gun deployment is limited by the need for large ammunition bunkers. ",Point Defense,,

Although heat-efficient, flak gun deployment is limited by the need for large ammunition bunkers. ",Point Defense,,
,,,,,
fs_subach,WEAPON,"The Subach-Innes HL-7 is a xaser weapon, firing an intense, highly focused beam of x-ray emissions. Until the Shivans appeared with their shield technology, these weapons were considered an unnecessary and costly extravagance. But Great War dogfights against Shivan craft quickly taught the Allies that their ships didn't stand a chance unless they could punch through shields. The HL-7 works superbly against shields of all varieties and has become the standard issue Primary weapon for all Terran fighters and bombers.",Assault,,
fs_mekhu,WEAPON,"The Mekhu HL-7 is the Vasudan re-engineered variant of the Subach HL-7 xaser. Modifications made to the design by engineers at Mekhu give it a higher firing rate and longer range than the original Terran version. These improvements come at the cost of a slight decrease in power output. This trade-off fits well with Vasudan military tactics, but most Terran pilots prefer the performance of the original weapon.",Assault,,
fs_prometheus_s,WEAPON,"Named after the Titan who gave fire to humanity, the Prometheus is a laser-based weapon - an advanced radar and X-ray tracking system lock on the target and determine the target's material structure - argon laser focused via transparent ceramic optics - the laser is generated at the destructive frequency (full out-of-phase) for the target's material structure - emitted no more than .02 ms after targeting and activation by the pilot, the Prometheus stands as one of the GTA's most effective deterrents to enemy attack, an effective form of defense for GTA pilots, and as a durable, portable, and highly destructive offensive tool.",Assault,,
fs_shivan_lightlaser,WEAPON,"Shivan weapon systems fire particle bursts with complex effects. Kinetic and thermal damage is the primary means of attack, but the weapons are not of sufficient power to match Alliance fighter-mounted equivalents. Strangely, Shivan weapons appear to contain sophisticated quantum computational systems which allow the burst to be programmed on the atomic level. The resultant attack can actually alter the probabilistic waveforms of baryonic matter and trigger zero-point energy microbursts.",Assault,,

fs_hornet,WEAPON,"The GTM-4 Hornet was showing its age even toward the end of the Great War, but it was cheap to manufacture. As a result, war-time production of the Hornet ran full-tilt at factories in eight star systems right up to the end of the war. After hostilities ceased, the GTVA found itself with an inventory of 2.6 million Hornet missiles. This stockpile has been spread among all GTVA battle groups, with each receiving at least 100,000 Hornets. This aspect-seeking missile still delivers a devastating four-missile punch, which makes it a consistent favorite of many pilots.",Strike,,
fs_piranha,WEAPON,"A third-generation version of the old Synaptic and Havoc missiles, the GTM-10 Piranha provides bombers with a high-explosive anti-fighter screen. The Piranha is detonated remotely by pressing the Secondary weapon trigger a second time. This releases over a dozen small, heat-seeking missiles that attack any enemy vessel within range. This function makes the missile effective against incoming wings of fighters in close formation. The Piranha is now the standard issue defensive weapon for bombers attacking targets protected by close fighter cover.",Anti-Fighter,,
,,,,,
tfight_herc2,SHIP,"The GTF Hercules Mark II is the next generation of Terran heavy assault fighter. Introduced during the Great War, the original Herc's balance of firepower and maneuverability made it the most versatile strike fighter in the fleet. Some military historians have claimed the Hercules won the Great War, citing its deployment in key battles near the end of the Shivan conflict. Implementing recent advances in fusion drive technology, the Mark II improves the assault fighter's speed and maneuverability without sacrificing loadout capacity.",,,
tfight_perseus,SHIP,"The GTF Perseus is the newest fighter in the GTVA's arsenal. Slated to replace the aging Valkyrie as the Alliance's primary interceptor, the Perseus's high max speed and maneuverability make it ideal to hunt and destroy enemy bombers. Perseus fighters have been assigned to the 3rd Battle Group on a trial basis, with wide deployment expected after the OpEval period. Primary weapons include the Subach HL-7 and Prometheus cannon, with secondary loads of Harpoon and Hornet missiles.",,,
tnon_support,SHIP,"The GTS Hygeia is fast and maneuverable, a necessity when trying to dock with fighters in the heat of battle. Triton Dynamics designed the Hygeia class with huge cargo bays for munitions storage, plus the latest magnetic-stasis delivery system for quickly re-supplying combat craft with missiles and bombs. The Hygeia's repair facilities are driven by neural-net AI, for ultra-fast system diagnostics and repair.",,,
tcap_deimos,SHIP," These sleek, ultra-modern warships are the products of a new era of ship design, maximizing maneuverability and firepower. Their hulls are strengthened with collapsed-core molybdenum sheathing for better protection against beam fire, and their Vasudan-designed reactor core provides more energy per ton than any other allied ship class.",,,
,,,,,
sfight_mara,SHIP,"The Mara seems to be a Shivan heavy attack fighter. It is not as maneuverable as other Shivan fighters, but it packs quite a punch, and it is very resistant to our weaponry.",,,
sfight_astaroth,SHIP,"The Astaroth is a fast, agile fighter that appears to have achieved its maneuverability at the expense of its armor and weaponry. Once the shields of an Astaroth are down, the fighter can be dispatched quickly.",,,
scap_moloch,SHIP,"Only one class of Shivan ship is classified as a corvette - the SCv Moloch class. Though they're physically as large as the GTCv Deimos class, Molochs do not seem to pack the same punch. They are far more deadly than any Shivan cruisers, however.",,,
scap_demon,SHIP,"While the Demon-class Destroyer is easily one of the most massive ships we have yet seen, it is not the biggest or most powerful in the Shivan armada. However, it is still quite dangerous, with a plethora of missile turrets and two full squadrons of fighters. It is suggested that these capital ships be destroyed by bombers, as all cruisers that have attempted to engage a Demon have been destroyed.",,,
,,,,,
vfight_tauret,SHIP,"While integrating cutting-edge technology developed in collaboration with the Terrans, the Tauret boasts a distinctly Vasudan design. Its unusual configuration was inspired by the Apsu-Hek, a creature that once inhabited the deserts of Vasuda Prime. The Apsu-Hek has become an emblem of the Vasudan diaspora, and the Tauret continues the tradition of symbolic design. Armed with four gun mounts and two missile banks, the Tauret has the speed and firepower to challenge both fighters and warships.",,,
vfight_serapis,SHIP,"Fast and highly maneuverable, the GVF Serapis is primarily used as a bomber interceptor. Its thin armor and weak shields give it a low survival rate in dogfights against more heavily armored fighters. Despite having only two primary and secondary weapon banks, the Serapis has been retrofitted to accommodate almost any loadout in the GTVA arsenal. Veteran Vasudan pilots love the Serapis for its agility and loadout options.",,,
vnon_support,SHIP,"The GVS Nephtys is fast and maneuverable, a necessity when trying to dock with fighters in the heat of battle. Mekhu Enterprises built a cargo bay into the rear of the ship, enabling it to carry extra supplies and munitions during emergencies. Mekhu Enterprises licensed the GTS Hygeia's magnetic-stasis delivery system from Triton Dynamics, so both ships are equally adept at re-supplying combat craft with missiles and bombs.",,,
vcap_sobek,SHIP,"Design of the corvette class GVCv Sobek began in the dark days after the destruction of Vasuda Prime by the Shivans in the Great War. The Vasudan navy wanted a vessel that could single-handedly counter powerful Shivan cruisers and provide critical support to Vasudan destroyers in battles against Shivan capital ships. The Sobek class fills those requirements admirably. Bristling with almost two dozen turrets, these corvettes are a terror to all vessels of cruiser size and below, while presenting a dire threat even to ships far larger than themselves.",,,
